# Iot--Based-Temperature-Monitoring-System-for-Affordable-Healthcare-Solutions
To develop an affordable and real-time IoT-based temperature monitoring system that enables continuous health tracking, especially in rural and underserved areas, using simple, low-cost components.
The project is implemented using an Arduino Uno, an NTC thermistor sensor, and an I2C LCD display to measure and display real-time body temperature.
